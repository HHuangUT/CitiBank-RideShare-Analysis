The typical ride length for all users were 4-6 hours. If not within that window, the rides typically ran longer (shown above). This trend present across both male and female genders, although more exaggerated in male (due to user count).

There is a small trend where younger users tend to ride longer than older riders, denoted by the positive slope of the trend line (shown above).

Majority of Customers are younger, but the spike in the older age group is from the Nonsuscriber/UNKOWN data set.

The peak hours are durring work week days and commuting windows.
For non-suscribers, the peak is during weekends (could be skewed by tourists).

# Results

## Strong Regular Customer Base
Majority of the customers are Male, and ~85% of the customers are Annual Suscribers. Majority of Nonsuscribers are listed as UNKNOWN.

## Commuters are most frequent customers
The peak hours are durring work week days and commuting windows.
For non-suscribers, the peak is during weekends (could be skewed by tourists).

## Downtown Hotspot
Downtown Manhattan is the most popular location across all genders and age groups, especially the locations along the water. This could suggest popular tourist spots as well.


# Summary

Downtown Manhattan is the most popular location, and the data supports that work week commuters are the most regular customers for this ride share program. This implies that CitiBike is operating as a sufficient alternative to public transportation. Room for growth can be found by capturing the tourist customer base. The most popular locations are already near popular tourist locations.

More metrics to look at for future improvement:
- User position/route data to look at most popular routes and stations

    This would aid in knowing where to put more bikes/bike stations for higher exposure.
    Coordinating this with city traffic data, could lead to more incentive for city to build more bike lanes.
- Maintenance/Condition data to determine which bikes/locations provide the most wear and tear on the bike

    This would put more bikes where needed and less bikes that have been "abandoned", which can hurt the appeal of renting bikes.
